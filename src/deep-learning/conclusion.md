## In conclusion, should you use Rust for Deep Learning?

* Like the whole Rust ecosystem, you should use it if it’s the best tool for the job. If you really need performance 🏎️ and resilience🛡️, and you are ok to have a stack in Rust, go ahead🚀! But be aware that making Rust fast is not easy!
* If you need quick prototyping with a data scientist friendly language, you should better use Python!
