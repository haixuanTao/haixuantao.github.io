## Polars

Well, [**Polars**](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars) tries to do just that. It allows you to do read, write, filter, apply functions, group by and merge, all in a **thread-safe fashion**.

It uses [**Apache Arrow**](https://github.com/apache/arrow), a data framework purposely built for doing efficient data processing and data sharing across language.

### Polars Lazy

Polars also offers a query optimized version called Lazy with a slightly different API. In my use case, I did not find it hard to go from one to the other, but I did not find any significant increase in performance either. The result is in the overall performance.

## 3 reasons for choosing **Polars**

### Reason #1. Performance.

itâ€™s killing it [performance-wise](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/).

### Reason #2. The API is straightforward.

Do you want to mutate the data? Use `apply`. Do you want to filter the data? use `filter`. Do you want to merge? Use `join` . There is not going to be rust syntax like `struct`, `derive`, `impl` â€¦

### Reason #3. No troubles with the borrow checker.

It uses Arc, Mutex like referencing, which means that you can clone variables as much as you like. Variables are only references to in-memory data. No more fighting with the borrow checker. Mutability is limited to the API calls, which preserve the consistency/thread-safety of the data.

## 3 caveats of **Polars**

### â€Œâ€ŒCaveat #1. Issuesâ€¦

Building a DataFrame API is hard. Itâ€™s so hard, Pandas took 12 years to reach 1.0.0. And,  as Polars is rather young, you may face unexpected issues. In my cases, there were issues with [\\n characters](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/issues/387),[ double quotes characters](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/pull/399), and [long utf8](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/pull/400).

On the other hand, those are great first issues to get started with contribution and getting better at Rust ðŸ”¨

### Caveat #2. Getting comfortable with two APIs: Polars and Arrow.

As many of the heavy liftings are done using the Apache Arrow backend, youâ€™ll have to get used to reading both documentation. Both documentations are pretty straightforward, but it might feel tiring for someone who was looking for a drop-in replacement of Pandas.

### Caveat #3. Compiling timeâ€¦

Sadly, compiling time takes around [6min](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/issues/402) uncached. And, it uses a lot of resources.
