## Polars

Well, [**Polars**](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars) allows you to do read, write, filter, apply functions, group by and merge, all in a similar API as Pandas but in Rust.

It uses [**Apache Arrow**](https://github.com/apache/arrow), a data framework purposely built for doing efficient data processing and data sharing across language.

## 3 reasons for choosing Polars

### Reason #1. Performance.

itâ€™s killing it [performance-wise](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/).

### Reason #2. The API is straightforward.

Do you want to mutate the data? Use `apply`. Do you want to filter the data? use `filter`. Do you want to merge? Use `join` . There is not going to be rust syntax like `struct`, `derive`, `impl` â€¦

### Reason #3. No troubles with the borrow checker.

It uses Arc-Mutex, which means that you can clone variables as much as you like. Variables are only references to in-memory data. No more fighting with the borrow checker. Mutability is limited to the API calls, which preserve the consistency/thread-safety of the data.

## 3 caveats of Polars

### â€Œâ€ŒCaveat #1. Issuesâ€¦

Building a DataFrame API is hard. Pandas took 12 years to reach 1.0.0. And,  as Polars is rather young, you may face unexpected issues. In my cases, there were issues with [\\n characters](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/issues/387),[ double quotes characters](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/pull/399), and [long utf8](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/pull/400).

On the other hand, those are great first issues to get started with contribution and getting better at Rust ðŸ”¨.

### Caveat #2. Getting comfortable with two APIs: Polars and Arrow.

As many of the heavy liftings are done using the Apache Arrow backend, youâ€™ll have to get used to reading the documentation of Polars but also Apache Arrow. Both documentations are pretty straightforward, but it might feel tiring for someone who was looking for a drop-in replacement of Pandas.

### Caveat #3. Compiling timeâ€¦

Sadly, compiling time takes around [3min](https://github.com/ritchie46/polars/issues/402) uncached. And, it uses a lot of resources.


## Case Study

**Now the question is, is it better than native Rust as Iâ€™ve explained** [**in my previous blog post**](/01-pandas-vs-rust.html)**?**

Letâ€™s take a hands-on comparison for a Data Pipeline and get a feel for it.

In this case study, Iâ€™m going to use the [stack overflow kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/data?select=2012-07+Stack+Overflow.7z). Iâ€™m going to read the database, parse the dates, make a merge between the first tag and the[ Wikipedia comparison of programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages#Failsafe_I/O_and_system_calls). Group by the status of the question asked. And retrieve the distribution of languageâ€™s features within each â€˜statusâ€™ of questions.

Weâ€™ll compare Polars API & Native Rust generic heap structure to do this task.

* _Iâ€™ll go slightly quicker on the native Rust, as I already put more details_ [_here_](https://able.bio/haixuanTao/data-manipulation-pandas-vs-rust--1d70e7fc)_._
* _Multithreading is done on 12 threads Intel\(R\) Core\(TM\) i7-8750H / 20G RAM._
* _The database is 4.2G big for around 3.6 Million rows._
