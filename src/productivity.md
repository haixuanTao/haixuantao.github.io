## VSCode

VSCode makes it really easy to have flexibility and automation put in place.

Productivity shortcut I use on daily basis:

- <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> : To open a file
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> : To open the terminal
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> : To access extension functionilities.
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>+`Open User Settings(JSON)` : For scripted settings.
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>+`Snippets` : For automating the generation of code.

## Vim (VSCode)

Vim idea is to allow automation on-the-lfy given a set of functionality to each key.

Vim has some great automation features that I just can't live without:
- <kbd>/</kbd> : Search
- <kbd>v</kbd> : Visual mode to select block of text
- <kbd>:</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> : Replace within a selection
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd> ... <kbd>f</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd> : Jump in and out of vim mode
- <kbd>.</kbd> : Repeat previous command.

## Touchtyping

Touch Typing main idea is that you can type faster by moving less your hands.

And, you can reduce hand movement by learning how to maximize the utilization of your fingers.

Features I use on a daily basis:
- Not having sour wrist.
