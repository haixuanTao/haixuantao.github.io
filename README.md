# Personal Portfolio made with Mdbook


Inspired by [Rustdoc resume](https://yozhgoor.github.io/yohan_boogaert_1995/), I wanted to use a Rust tool to build an enhanced resume. Mdbook seemed like a great fit, and what is a resume other than a documentation of self.

In the current status of my porfolio, you can see a:
- about me: page with badges linking to the respecting web pages 
 - work experience page
 - an education pages
 - a skill page
- a page presenting a project + its badges
- a documentation of a Pull Review
- several analytical blogpost
- custom css
- Continuous Deployment for Github page

# For development

```
mdbook serve
```
